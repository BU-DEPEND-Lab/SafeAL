Learning result for safety specification:

P<=0.1[true U<=64 'unsafe']

>>>>>>>>Apprenticeship Learning learnt policy
PRISM model checking result: 1.000000

>>>>>>>>Safety-Aware Apprenticeship Learning learnt policy
PRISM model checking result: 0.000000
Experiment: gridworld

>>>>>>>>Apprenticeship Learning learns a policy  which is an optimal policy of reward function as in the figure.
Given safety spec:
P=? [U<= 64 'unsafe']

PRISM model checking the probability of reaching the unsafe states: 0.377522
Experiment: gridworld

>>>>>>>>Apprenticeship Learning learns a policy  which is an optimal policy of reward function as in the figure.
Given safety spec:
P=? [U<= 81 'unsafe']

PRISM model checking the probability of reaching the unsafe states: 0.870516
