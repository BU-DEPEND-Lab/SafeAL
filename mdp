// Strategy for step-bounded properties
// format: stateId, b1, c1, b2, c2,..., bn, cn
// (b1>b2>...>bn)
// where: ci  (1<=i<n )is the choice taken when the number of steps remaining before the bound is exceeded is >=bi and <bi+1
// cn is the choice taken after bn or less steps remain until bound is exceeded.
Strategy:
